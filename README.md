# Timesheet

This repository is a serverless SPA web app used to track tasks and time invested in them. Uses PNPM as package manager and IndexedDB for data storage.

## Installation

Install dependencies using pnpm to prevent a black-hole of `node_modules` as everybody knows. Use other package managers at your own risk. ðŸ˜‰

```
pnpm install
```

To build the distribution package and generate the app in the `dist` folder execute:

```
pnpm build
```

Now you can upload the `dist` folder anywhere, or open it from a localhost to give it a try.
